# Welcome to Wikipedia_Search_Dashboard
Wikipedia Search Dashboard - Web APP

Greetings to all. In this project, we'll build a web application for the MERN stack Wikipedia Search Dashboard.
We'll examine how to use Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication. Use the Wikipedia app to add search capabilities to our app, record user and user search history, and obtain statistics on the number of users who have used it day and hour by utilising charts.
